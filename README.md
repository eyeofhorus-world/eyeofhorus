Do you feel like someone in the media you consume has said, or produced, something untruthful? Share it with the Eye of Horus.

Agree on truth together, as a collective, everyone is just another user, including the maintainers of the software.

(it's like the real version of this fun, neat, family-friendly, fictional character from a popular novel: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother)

You could also just be a troll, anything that is possible is allowed, no exceptions as of yet except for of course criminal activity etc.



Queries to Horus, are currently limited to 414 characters of text, otherwise it is for Horus to decide.
