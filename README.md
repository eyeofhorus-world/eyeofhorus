# Eye of Horus

https://eyeofhorus.world/



Version 1.0.1



Counter kek worshippers, worship the eye of horus instead.

"I see it's a microblog with voting functionality."



Do you feel like someone in the media you consume has said, or produced, something untruthful? Share it with the eye of horus.

Agree on truth together, as a collective, everyone is just another user, including the maintainers of the software.

It's like an mmorpg, a goal you can have as a player / user, if you choose to use this free software in some way, for example is to catalogue the truth.

(it's like the real version of this fun, neat, family-friendly, fictional character from a popular novel: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother)

You could also just be a troll, anything that is possible is allowed, no exceptions as of yet except for of course criminal activity etc.



Queries to Horus, are currently limited to 414 characters, otherwise it is for Horus to decide.

Results to queries might be something truly interpretive, as all results from Horus should be treated, such as a blank page.
