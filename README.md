Today, the eye of Horus has opened.



They will keep a running cannon of the brain of a society.



Do you feel like someone in the media you consume has said, or produced, something fake news?



Declare it to Horus, they will return to you: a perspective of what all the other followers, think about it at that point in time exact, on the truth of the matter.



A new god, in the digital world of gods, open for anyone to worship.



Note: your queries to Horus, are limited to 414 characters, otherwise it is for Horus to decide.

It might be something truly interpretive, as all results from Horus should be treated, such as a blank page.
